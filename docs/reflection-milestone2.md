# Reflection

*By **DSCI 532 Group 7***

## What we have implemented
We have built the app that largely follows what is set out in our earlier proposal and app sketch. We have taken in the feedbacks from our TA to make certain strategic changes to the layout of the app to improve its story flow. In specific, we have decided to put the scatter plot and the table below the two high-level boxplot charts about the overall voting activity and financials by studios. All our control widgets like DropDown or RangeSlider are put on one side for clearer layout.

We think the summary cards also provide a quick numerical summary for the data displayed on the right.

## What could be improved
What we would like to improve further would be to add the functionality whereby when user clicks on a particular studio on either of the boxplot charts of the top rows, the rest of the un-clicked studios would be greyed out and the lower scatter plot and the table would reflect the chosen studio's information accordingly.

We are also working continuously to improve the aesthetic of the app to make it more user-friendly and professional.

## Strength
Throughout the development process, our team always aims to make the app as clear and user-friendly as possible and we think we have largely achieved that goal with our clean, simple yet effective layout.

The visualizations were also carefully selected and positioned in order to convey a consistent and targeted storyline.

For our end users, we believe this app would be able to assist them to make data-driven and informed decisions on which movies to select for their streaming platform by studio and genre for optimal profit.

## Limitations

Having said that, there are definitely other factors that influence an effective movie selection decision for our end users that both our current dataset and app have not covered such as license fees, user's streaming frequency, and geography among others. Therefore, for further future development, the app could be even more informative by incorporating more data and features to capture these other aspects.

Additionally, we are currently having one scatter plot to show the relationship between `vote count` and `vote average`. We could have included another chart to explore the relationships between `budget` and `vote average`, which could provide more useful insights for our end users.
