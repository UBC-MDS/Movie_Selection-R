## 1. Work distribution: 
* Work distribution aim for equal split among team members and respects each team member’s preference if the situation allows. 

## 2. Communication forms: 

* Using GitHub Issues, organized by label and milestones

## 3. Group meeting: 
* Frequency: 2-3 times per week and when there is a clear agenda to meet
* Timing: Time for the next meeting is determined by all members in the current meeting. Otherwise, tentative timing is **2pm PST Monday (lab time)** and **5pm PST Friday weekly (tentative)**. Meeting times should suit all members’ current timezone. Meeting times can be altered if certain members cannot make for the tentative timing and the rest are agreeable.
* Meeting minutes, notes, agenda for next meeting. Each member takes turn to write meeting minutes and notes for the current meeting and agenda for the next meeting and post it as a Github Issues under appropriate label and milestones. The minutes serve as guiding notes for each member post meetings.

## 4. Working style:
* Work progress to be posted as a GitHub Issues/Pull Request with link to the actual file 1 hours before meeting
* Keep team member updated via GitHub Issues


## 5. Work quality expectation:
* Complete
* On time
* Codes are executable, pass unit tests and follow formatting standard
* Minimal grammar typo mistake
* Able to explain the problem to the rest


## 6. GitHub workflow:
* Fork main repo to personal GitHub and work on each member forked repo, commit and push on each person’ repo. Git commit messages should be meaningful.
* **Work/code on the project’s virtual environment (as opposed to root's environment) to ensure reproducibility. Update the yaml file when needed.**
* After work completion, send pull-requests of the work to the upstream repo (the one they forked) for another to review (clone + try the code) and before merging the pull request. 
* After merging of pull requests from all members and the team starts to work on the main group repo, each member should remember check with the rest of the team to see anyone is working on it,  pull before working
* Try to have all pull requests put up by **Friday 23.59pm PST** for review on Saturday.
 
## 7. Other important principles:
* Be transparent, clear, direct, respectful in communication
* Do ask/raise issue if you are not clear/ do not agree so the issues can be solved together as a team early
* Be open to critics and a constructive critics to others
