## Overview

![app_demo](docs/images/app_demo.gif?raw=true)

The app displays information on movie investment strategies based on factors like genre, budget, revenue, studios, and top rated movies, etc. The target audience of this app are online streaming service companies and movie investors. On the left panel of the app, the users would be able to use the dropdown menu to select a genre and use a slide bar to choose budget range that suit their interest. Based on the selected genre and budget, the app will display average revenue and profit as highlighted text. The middle panel of the app shows the financials and voting average of the studios given selected genre and budget. After reviewing the performance of the studios, the users would be able to filter to their studio of interest by clicking on the dropdown menu on the right panel of the app. The app will then display the movie ratings and top 10 movies with name, profit, run time and vote average for the selected genre, budget and studio so that the investors would get an idea on the successful movies that suit their appetite.
